This project is my course project from the first year of university on "software development technology" subject.
The software is developed in C programming language with elements of C++ as a console application. The programming paradigm for this project is procedural.
During the process of work, there have been developed some user functions to enable work with data of telephone conversations (such as viewing, editing, adding, etc.) and with users of the program (registration, authorization, blocking, etc.).
Algorithms of function operation have been developed, such as: main menu, forms of authorization and registration, menu of modules of user and administrator, algorithms of search and sorting.
Procedural and partially object-oriented programming principles have been used in this application. The following programming language tools were used: structures, functions, files, etc.
