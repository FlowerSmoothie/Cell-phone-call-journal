**This project is my course project from the first year of university on "software development technology" subject.**

The application is a system for managing data about phone calls, similar to those that could be used by mobile operators. The software features include:
- possibility of authorization under different roles (normal user and administrator);
- ability to manage users' accounts via the administrator account (basic login and password for an admin account: admin - admin);
- viewing and editing information about phone calls (adding data, editing, deleting, searching and filtering);
    - additional: output of certain parameters for each subscriber in the required time period (list of incoming and outgoing calls, total time of incoming calls, total time of outgoing calls, total sum of outgoing calls) (marked as "___individual task___").
   

The software is developed in C programming language with elements of C++ as a console application. The programming paradigm for this project is procedural.

During the process of work, there have been developed some user functions to enable work with data of telephone conversations (such as viewing, editing, adding, etc.) and with users of the program (registration, authorization, blocking, etc.).

Algorithms of function operation have been developed, such as: main menu, forms of authorization and registration, menu of modules of user and administrator, algorithms of search and sorting.

Procedural and partially object-oriented programming principles have been used in this application. The following programming language tools were used: structures, functions, files, etc.
